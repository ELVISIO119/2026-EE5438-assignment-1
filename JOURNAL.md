## Project setup

Objective: improve Fashion-MNIST classification using only MLPs while keeping a clear record of architecture, optimizer, regularization and inference costs.

First task: establish the supplied-style sigmoid/SGD baseline with seed 58561440. Reserve 6,000 examples for validation. The completed run reached **54.78% validation accuracy** at epoch 50. This is the reference to beat; the next branch changes only the optimizer.

The baseline is intentionally plain: 784 inputs → 128 sigmoid units → 64 sigmoid units → 10 logits, cross-entropy loss, SGD at 0.001, batch size 128 and 50 epochs. Training took about 5.6 seconds on the recorded CUDA environment. The result is evidence, not a test-set score.

For every feature, record its hypothesis, the exact comparison, measured outcome, limitations and the next decision. Record wall-clock timestamps when measurements finish; never backdate entries.
